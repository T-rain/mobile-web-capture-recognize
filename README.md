1. Thanks to my members,Angela,robotxdd,
weiting,lily

1. This is a mobile web using [jquery-mobile](https://jquerymobile.com)

1. The server is based on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) & [Express](http://expressjs.com)

1. The ocr is provided by [Bitocr](www.bitocr.com) (PS: OK,I know that the link is broken,but in that time I use the api there)

1. In this project,there is a surprise. If you run on localhost:3000, just add path "/camera",or you can try  [this](https://onboard.eu-gb.mybluemix.net/camera) (PS: OK, I need to say that you need to use opera or chrome,because I use [getUserMedia](http://caniuse.com/#search=getUserMedia))

1. Thanks for the jquery plugin [WeatherFeed](https://github.com/dhardin/WeatherFeed)

1. Take a look on https://onboard.eu-gb.mybluemix.net

1. Last,I need to do more for this,such as ocr,webcam.js,other paas.
